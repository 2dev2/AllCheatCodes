** Pitfalls For Geek Culture
| Name                                     | Second Thinking                                                                  |
|------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| No information barrier; sharing anything | Information is power and profit margin. Only share the relevant                  |
| No hierarchy; just talk with code        | It's more about people and business                                              |
| Make all the possible improvements       | You may miss the priority and cross-functions cooperation                        |
| Value inovation over cooperation         | Working solo helps to try ideas faster; but PoC is different from products       |
| Be absolutely accurate                   | Human is not machine; So it is software development world                        |
| Curse of knowledge                       | Normal people are not dummy; they just don't have experience you have            |
| Assume everyone is with good will        | You may be set up or manipulated                                                 |
| Rarely think about monetization          | Face it. Funding is very important, even for open source projects                |
| Communication is not actionable          | Keep talking fancy tech, but few impressive highlights or actionable items       |
| Do everything in a hard way              | Intellectual challenges may not be cost effective; you can't do everything       |
| Reference                                | [[https://cheatsheet.dennyzhang.com/cheatsheet-it-career-A4][CheatSheet: IT Career Path]], [[https://cheatsheet.dennyzhang.com/cheatsheet-communication-A4][Cheatsheet: IT Communication]], [[https://cheatsheet.dennyzhang.com/cheatsheet-opensource-A4][Cheatsheet: Opensource]] |
